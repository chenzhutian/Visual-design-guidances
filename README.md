| 1 | 2017 | Assessing the Graphical Perception of Time and Speed on 2D+Time Trajectories | Charles Perin, Tiffany Wun, Richard Pusch, and Sheelagh Carpendale | Although InfoVis designers often have to decide how to visually encode time and speed information on 2D+time trajectories, so far no studies have been conducted to assess the relative interpretability of these visual encodings and no guidelines exist for helping designers in making such decisions. ... For simple straight or curved paths (no complex shape, sharp angles or loops), and when it is important to estimate the speed and/or time value at a point on the path | <ol><li>The best choices are either to encode speed with brightness/color value and time with segment length, or to encode both time and speed using segment length only. </li> <li>If using segment length is not desirable, the next best choice is to encode speed with color value and time with size.</li></ol> |         |
